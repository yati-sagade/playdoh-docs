Installation

Requirements
------------

You need `Python`_ 2.6 or 2.7, `MySQL`_, `git`_, virtualenv_, and a Unix like
OS.

.. _`git`: http://git-scm.com/

Starting a project based on playdoh
-----------------------------------

The secret to what makes playdoh fun is
the `funfactory <https://github.com/mozilla/funfactory>`_ module.
When you install funfactory
`from PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/funfactory>`_
or `from source <https://github.com/mozilla/funfactory>`_ you
get a command line script that you can use to start a new playdoh project.
Install funfactory with a package manager like `pip`_::

    pip install funfactory

You'll now have the Playdoh installer script.
Read through ``funfactory --help`` or start a new project like this::

    funfactory --python=python2.6 --pkg=yourapp

The automatic install process goes like this:

1. Clone the `Playdoh git repository`_
2. Create a custom ``yourapp`` package
3. Create a `virtualenv`_ named ``yourapp`` (if not already in a virtualenv)
4. Install/compile all requirements
5. Create a local settings file in ``yourapp/settings/local.py``
   and fill in some settings.

.. note::

   If a virtualenv needs to be created and you have
   ``virtualenvwrapper`` installed, the created virtualenv  will go in
   your ``WORKON_HOME`` directory. Otherwise the virtualenv will be
   installed in ``.virtualenv``.

.. seealso::

    :doc:`Installing everything automatically in a Vagrant VM <vagrant>`

The Playdoh project layout uses a vendor library, i.e. a subdirectory ``vendor``
that contains all pure Python libraries required. In addition, a few C based
libraries (such as MySQL-python, bcrypt, etc) get built by the installer. For more
information on vendor libraries, read :ref:`packages`.

Configuration
-------------

By default the funfactory installer configures your app to use a `MySQL`_
database named ``playdoh_app``. You'll need to create the database manually::

    mysql -u root -e 'create database playdoh_app;'

If you need to adjust any settings for the database connection,
edit ``yourproject/settings/local.py``.
Synchronize tables and initial data::

    ./manage.py syncdb

Start the development server::

    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You can now view the dev server at http://localhost:8000/ -- hooray!

If you start adding pieces that should go back into playdoh, you will probably
want to patch `funfactory`_, which is the core of Playdoh.

If your app's configuration requires you to add or remove apps, middleware, or
template context processors from the default funfactory configuration, you can
use the ``get_apps``, ``get_middleware``, and ``get_context_processors``
functions. See the :ref:`settings management API <settings>` documentation.

.. _`MySQL`: http://www.mysql.com/

Installing a project by hand
----------------------------

The installer script automates everything you'd need to do by hand but it's
simple to do it yourself. Here's what you would do:

1. Clone the `Playdoh git repository`_ into ``customproject``.
2. cd into that directory and rename ``project`` to ``customproject``
   (this is the actual Python module).
3. Edit setup.py so the module name is ``customproject``
4. Copy ``customproject/settings/local.py-dist`` to
   ``customproject/settings/local.py``.
5. Edit ``local.py``:

   - Fill in your DB credentials
   - Enter a secret key
   - Enter an HMAC key for bcrypt password hashing

6. Create a `virtualenv`_ (if not already in one)
7. Run ``git submodule update --init --recursive``
8. Run ``pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt``

Then you should be ready to run syncdb and start up the server::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
